## 🚀 1. What’s the Point?
**What problem does this paper solve, and why is it important?**  
This paper introduces an attention mechanism to GNNs, which generalises the use of RNNs in context to graphs. Attention allows the model to adapt to a graph with a different structure from the one it was trained on.

## 🧠 2. The Core Idea
**What’s the main idea, approach, or innovation in one sentence?**  
Add a stack of self-attentaion layers on top on the graph network (or mutli-head for better stabilization)

## 🔬 3. Setup & Experiment Details (Fill after *Methods + Experiments section*)  
- **Datasets used**:  
- **Architecture / Algorithm**:  
- **Training tricks / Hyperparameters (if given)**:  
- **Evaluation metrics**:  

> ✅ **Checkpoint:** Can you sketch the pipeline on paper or explain it out loud?

## 📊 4. Results (Fill after *Results section*)  
- **How well did it perform? Compared to what?**  
- **Any strong baselines beaten?**  
- **Was the improvement significant or just marginal?**

---

## ⚠️ 5. Limitations / Weaknesses (Skim *Discussion or Conclusion*)  
- **What does it assume?**  
- **Where does it break?**  
- **What’s missing?**

> ⚠️ If the authors didn’t mention it, think critically — **no model is perfect**.

## 🧪 8. How (or if) I can use this (Optional — after thinking a bit)
- Could I implement this in code?  
- Could I apply this to my dataset/project?  
- What toy version of this can I try?
